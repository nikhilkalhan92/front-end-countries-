# front-end-countries-

I used $ npm install country-json from the https://github.com/samayo/country-json.
Please enter NPM start on the terminal to open the website,

I used react as the front end interface. Creating 2 files in the src folder - CountryList.js & styles.css

I had to delete the node.modules folder - please clone the repo and run the command 'npm install' to bring the node folder back into your VS code and you can run the website. Thank you
